/**
 * Thread resolve/unresolve tests — adapted from old devtalk.e2e.spec.ts
 * "thread behavior" block.
 *
 * Changes from old plugin:
 * - No sidebar panel with visual resolve/unresolve buttons on server-rendered cards
 * - Resolve functionality exists at API level (threads:resolve-thread)
 * - Resolved threads get .threads-thread--resolved class (opacity: 0.55)
 * - The Lit-rendered threads-thread component has Resolve/Unresolve buttons,
 *   but the current inline mode uses server-rendered HTML

---

This playground is used to verify core engine changes in real-time. Use this to ensure your modifications to the Markdown parser or UI components behave as expected.

::: callout tip "How to work here"
To test your changes, keep the dev server running (`pnpm run dev`). Any change you make to `packages/core` or `packages/parser` will trigger a hot-reload here instantly.
:::

## Component Verification

Test your UI components and parser rules here to ensure visual consistency:

::: card "Container Test"
    Test nested callouts and containers.

    ::: callout warning "Warning"
    Ensure nested items render correctly.
    :::

::: tabs
== tab "Feature A"
### Feature A

== tab "Feature B"
### Feature B

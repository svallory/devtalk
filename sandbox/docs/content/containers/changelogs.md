The `changelog` container formats version history into a clean, vertical timeline. It is specifically designed to parse date/version headers and body content separately.

## Syntax

Use `==` to separate entries. The text on the `==` line becomes the timeline badge (left side), and the content below becomes the body (right side).

```markdown
::: changelog

== Version 2.0
Description of version 2.0.

== Version 1.0
Description of version 1.0.

:::
```

::: callout tip
Maintaining a clean changelog helps AI agents understand the evolution of your project. An AI can quickly scan a `::: changelog` structure to determine which features were added in a specific version, allowing it to provide more accurate context to users asking about "what's new".

**Generate beautiful, lightweight documentation sites directly from your Markdown files. Zero clutter, just content.**

`docmd` bridges the gap between simple static site generators and heavy, framework-driven applications. It processes standard Markdown into highly optimized static HTML, while delivering a buttery-smooth Single Page Application (SPA) experience for your users.

## Quick Start

**Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.**

Deploy a beautiful, searchable documentation site in seconds. No framework knowledge required.

**1. Install `docmd` as dependency in your project to lock your versions.**
```bash
npm install @docmd/core     # Install locally (Recommended)

npx docmd init              # Initialize your configuration
npx docmd dev               # Start developing
```

**2. Install Globally**
```bash
npm install -g @docmd/core  # Enables docmd to run anywhere on your local machine
```

**3. You can run `docmd` on-the-fly without installing it or setting up any config.**
```bash
npx @docmd/core dev -z      # Start local dev server instantly
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. Any changes you make to the files in the `docs/` folder will instantly update on your screen.

## Why choose docmd?

We believe writing documentation should be as frictionless as possible. You shouldn't need to configure complex JavaScript frameworks just to publish text. We also believe that modern tools should be built for **both humans and machines**. That's why `docmd` is arguably the most AI-friendly static documentation generator on the market, ready to be immediately digested by the newest wave of LLMs directly out of the box.

::: card SPA Performance
We serve static HTML for maximum SEO and speed. Once loaded, `docmd` transitions between pages as a high-performance Single Page Application, no full browser reloads, just instant content swaps.
